--- Based on the CPAN Phonix code calculator
--- Text::Phonetic::Phonix.pm, because the paper describing
--- the codes is not freely available and I'm lazy.
--- Also because Phonix involves over 150 substitution rules,
--- I transformed the Perl ones, which was easier than
--- generating them from scratch.

-- character of the code will be folded to uppercase.
-- Non-alphabetics are not encoded. If no alphabetics are
-- present, the phonix code will be "0".
