This library implements standard similarity hashes for the
sounds of words.  This sort of similarity hash is useful in
areas such as census-taking and spelling correction. The
codes here were implemented for my
[thimk](http://github.com/gregwebs/haskell-spell-suggest)
spelling word suggestion library and application.
